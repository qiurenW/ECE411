This file is a describation of the whole project.

The reason we don't use Solar Power 
  1. If we connect Solar panel to PCB directly, this power supply is not stable. 
  2. The pannel may not able to provide enough current for driving a motor.
  3. If we use a li-battery to store the solar power, we need to design a power management system, which will make this project two complex.
